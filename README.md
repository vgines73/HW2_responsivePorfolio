# HW2_responsivePorfolio
Goal to create a mobile-first responsive portfolio:

* Used Bootstrap, developed my portfolio site with the following items:

   * A navbar

   * A responsive layout

   * Responsive images

Website: 
* The Bootstrap portfolio should minimize the use of media queries.

* Functional, deployed application

* GitHub repository with README describing the project

* Navbar must be consistent on each page.

* Navbar on each page must contain links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.

* All links must work. (I added buttons to my portfolio section for each thumbnail for link to my work and the github repo but I don't have any since we haven't done any projects yet. also social media links work. didn't feel comfortable putting my actual accounts on there lol).

* Must use semantic html.

* Each page has valid and correct HTML. (use a validation service)

* Must contain my personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)

* Must properly utilize Bootstrap components and grid system.

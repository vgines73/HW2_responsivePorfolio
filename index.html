              <p>
                My name is Vincent Gines. Born and raised in hood of Stockton, CA. Living in Stockton was difficult.
                Basically, had to bust my ass in school to get out. In my hood, there were many obstacles that can deter
                you from acheiving your goals. I was fortunate to have a family who cared about me to help me focus on
                what's really important; an Education. After graduating from High School I attended college at UC
                Riverside.
                I thought to myself, I'm finally out of the hood and make something out of myself. Unfortunately,
                without my family by my side, I was on my own. Finding myself was a struggle. Expectations were high,
                but I was lost. I wasn't exposed enough to really be on my own growing up so you can say, "I fell
                through the cracks" and never finished.
              </p>
              <p>
                I worked from job to job trying to survive working my ass off to prove to myself
                and everyone I could do it. In a year became a Store Manager at Vans for five years. To be honest, I was
                actually making it and happy with what I was doing. My goal was to move into Corporate and was in the
                process of doing so, but then came the unthinkable; Recession, Budget cuts, and lay-offs. I was one of
                the many and lost my job. I worked for another companies but didn't see myself going where with it, that
                is until I found my wife.
              </p>
              <p>
                My wife and I moved out of SoCal after we got married and moved closer to the Bay Area where her family
                lives. A few years later we had two boys, both who are on the spectrum. My wife worked while I stayed
                back, caring for our children, taking them to their services to help them cope and be able to live this
                so-called "normal-life". My kids have showed me that life isn't so easy for everyone. That some of us
                need to work extra hard just
                to keep up. Watching them grow, how hard they have been working towards that goal, living a
                "normal-life", I realized I should also get myself in order, to make something of myself, which is why
                I'm here taking this course.

                Besides being a sports fanatic and active in sports, I enjoy watching anime and horror movies, hanging
                out with my children, cooking for my family, taking trips to Disneyland and Comic-Con, and drawing
                characters for my children.

              <p>
                My name is Vincent Gines. Born and raised in the hood of Stockton, CA. Living in Stockton was difficult.
                Basically, I had to bust my ass in school to get out. In my hood, there were many obstacles that can
                deter you from acheiving your goals. I was fortunate to have a family who cared about me to help me
                focus on what's really important; an Education. After graduating from High School I attended college at
                UC Riverside. I thought to myself, I'm finally out of the hood and can make something out of myself.
                Unfortunately, without my family by my side, I was on my own. Finding myself was a struggle.
                Expectations were high, but I was lost. I wasn't exposed enough to really be on my own growing up, so
                you can say, "I fell through the cracks," and never finished.
              </p>
              <p>
                I worked from job to job, trying to survive, working my ass off to prove to myself
                and everyone I could do make it on my own. In a year, I became a Store Manager at Vans and did it for
                five years. To be honest, I was making it work, and I was happy with what I was doing. My goal was to
                move into Corporate, and was in the process of doing so, but then came the unthinkable; Recession,
                Budget cuts, and lay-offs. I was one of the many and lost my job. I worked for another companies but
                didn't see myself going where with it. I thought it was it, that is until, I found my wife.
              </p>
              <p>
                My wife and I moved out of SoCal after we got married, and moved closer to the Bay Area where her family
                currently lives. A few years later, we had two boys, both who are on the spectrum. My wife worked, while
                I stayed back, caring for our children, taking them to their services to help them cope, and be able to
                live this so-called "normal-life". My kids have showed me that life isn't so easy for everyone. That
                some of us need to work extra hard just to keep up. Watching them grow, how hard they have been working
                towards that goal, living a "normal-life", I realized I should also get myself in order, to make
                something of myself, which is why I'm here taking this course.
